# EC441 Fall 2020
# Lab2: network detective / final exam prep

# The purpose of this lab is to prepare you for
# your take-home final exam, which will have a 
# similar format.


# This lab can be performed with 2 authors.

# Download the file  lab2_ec441_fall2020.pcapng
# from the following url
# 
# http://curl.bu.edu:44120/static/content/lab2_ec441_fall2020.pcapng
#
# and answer the following questions about the packets captured
#
#
# The answers should be written into the variables provided.

# When you are done, submit this file at
#   http://curl.bu.edu:44120/assignment/lab2


#
# This problem can be completed using any combination of
# wireshark, tshark, pyshark


# Directions: replace -1 with the correct value, like 42 or 0 or 3.14

# Q0. How many packets were captured?

packet_count = 5221#sum1#5221

# Q1. How many ICMP packets were captured?

icmp_packet_count = 58#sum2#58


# Q2. How many IPv6 packets were captured?

ipv6_packet_count =0# sum3 # 0

# Q3. How many unique IP addresses were captured

ip_unique_count = 6# sum4 # 6

# Q4. A problem solving chart was downloaded and the exchange was recorded.
# How many arrows lead to the "Oh No!" box.

ohno_arrows = 3 # if done directly if indirectly the number is 7  # done manually through wire shark 


# Q5. A file "large_word_list.txt" was retrieved from a website. What
# was the throughput for this request, measured in megabits/second?
# NOTE: throughput is defined as  DATA / TIME. For the time,
# use the time required from the HTTP GET  until the file was delivered, 
# and use the file size as the amount of data delivered (making sure
# to convert the units into Mb/s)
