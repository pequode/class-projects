# **Class Projects**
## Purpose:
A list of class projects that shows what I covered in a few of my classes. These are a mix of homework assignments and custom calculators that I built. I use this repo for reference on topics that I haven't covered in a while. I have tried to remove all copyrighted material. Please raise an issue if you see something that I missed.  
## contents:
- Computer Organization:
  - helper scripts: a collection of scripts and calculators used for debuging
  - lab3: ASM
  - lab5: pipeline cpu in verilog.
- Operating systems:
  - helper scripts: tester for basic c commands
  - P1/ Shell: code for a shell which allows piping and running detached processes.
  - P2/ threading: basic code for implementing multi-threading using system calls  
  - P3/ threading with sem: added semaphore support and lock to threads.
  - P4/ thread local storage: added thread local storage to previous project
  - demo slides for explaining thread implementation.
- Computer Networks:
  - Lab 1 : determining capacity
  - Lab 2 : pyshark
  - Functions: lots of useful calculators. **Highlights**:
    - alpha,beta (sockets)
    - RttCalc (calculates round trip time)
- Machine Learning:
  - Backpropagation
  - Clustering( K-means,DP-means )
  - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
  - Kernels, K-means, EM
  - Linear Binary Classification
  - Linear Regression
  - Neural_Networks
  - Optimization, KNN, Decision Trees
- Cyber-Security: the big project for this class is listed as its own repo
  - helper scripts: a collection of scripts I used to solve the CTF like challenges.
