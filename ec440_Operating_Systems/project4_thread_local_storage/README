Process of Development
	Most of the time spent on this homework was devoted to geting the all of edge cases. 
	Because its really hard to tell if the homework was wrong it required me developing extensive tests. 
	The first 2 days I spend doing research in the man pages for mmap and sigaction as well as copying and reviewing the discussion lectures slides code. The first problem I ran into was that the auto grader didnt like it when I used my pthread library. As soon as I started using the regular one it began to 
	work. I spent more time than I would like to admit getting my makefile to work. After that the rest of the time I spent writing test cases and debugging my program. This homework was easier than the others for me,but I spend around 9 hours on a wrong implementation.
